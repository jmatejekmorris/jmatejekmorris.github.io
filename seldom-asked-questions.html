      <b>Q: If you could be any Broadway character, who would you be?</b><br>
      A: Great question! I would say I most relate to Natalie from <i>Next to Normal</i>. If I had talent and could perform any role, I would love to star as Bobby Strong in <i>Urinetown</i> or Nessarose in <i>Wicked</i>. But if I could be any character, I would choose Lucy from <i>You&apos;re a Good Man Charlie Brown</i>. She&apos;s confident, funny, and knows how to masterfully stretch out the word count of her writing assignments to hit a goal, which is an author's dream.

      <b>Q: Favorite walrus you&apos;ve ever met?</b><br>
      A: I have unfortunately not met any walruses at this time, but I would love to. If any walruses would like to meet me, please hit me up. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Q: What is a walrus&apos;s favorite treat?</b><br>
      A: George&apos;s favorite treat is ice cream, but he is only half walrus. I will reach out to a zoo and find out what other snacks whole walruses crave. Hopefully I will know before my website goes live, but if not, please hold! Be right back. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Update:</b> I have contacted the Indianapolis Zoo, who have a fantastic walrus exhibit (including a <a href="https://www.indianapoliszoo.com/exhibits/oceans/pacific-walrus/" target="_blank">live webcam</a>) and they have confirmed that their walruses most enjoy squid and a variety of fish.
      <br><br>
      <b>Q: What brand of socks do you wear?</b><br>
      A: I am not loyal to any particular brand, but I do love socks with fun animals or characters on them. Socks are a great way to add secret character to an outfit when you need to be mostly professional. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Q: Has a bird ever pooped on your head?</b><br>
      A: A bird has not pooped on my head, but now that I have posted this on my website, I suspect one will do so any day now. A bird has pooped on my back. Here is a picture of my face when that happened. I was not thrilled.

      <div class="seldom-picture-div"><img class="seldom-picture" src="/images/BirdPoop.jpeg" alt="Jimmy looks very unpleased as a bird has just pooped on his shoulder. The picture was taken at the Boston Commons."/></div>
      
      Also. <a href="/dont-say-poop.html">Don&apos;t say poop</a>. 
      <br><br>
      <b>Q: What is your second favorite number?</b><br>
      A: Hmm. I am not sure that I have ever considered this. 23 is probably my first favorite number because it is the date of my birthday and my anniversary. Let&apos;s go with 6 because Ernie and Bert sing a lovely little song about 6. (Bert&apos;s favorite number is 6.)
