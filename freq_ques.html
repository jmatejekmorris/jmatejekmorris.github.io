				<b>Q: What books were your favorite growing up and most influenced you?</b><br>
				A: My absolute favorite book growing up was <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>. Veruca Salt remains one of my favorite characters to date. I also remember reading and rereading There&apos;s a <i>Boy in the Girl&apos;s Bathroom</i> and the <i>Wayside School</i> series, both by Louis Sachar. I have always been a bit of a slow reader, so as a kid I enjoyed books infused with humor or whimsy that would keep me hooked. Works such as these have influenced my own writing as I aspire to balance humor and heart. 
				<br><br>
				<b>Q: Who are your favorite authors?</b><br>
				A: Every time I finish a book, it becomes a new favorite. I am always so impressed by the range of stories out there in the world, and I am so excited to read authors whose works I&apos;ve never encountered before. Recent favorite authors include Kelly Yang, Adam Silvera, Becky Albertalli, Jo Knowles, Chad Sell, Angie Thomas, Mackenzie Lee, Tim Federele, Tiffany D. Jackson, Nicola Yoon, and so many more. Always happy to talk about favorites and make specific recommendations!
