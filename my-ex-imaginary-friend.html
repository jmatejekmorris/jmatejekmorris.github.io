      Jack hasn&apos;t seen his imaginary friend George since his tenth birthday, almost a year ago. 
      <br><br>
      His mom figures Jack simply outgrew George, but Jack suspects that George left of his own accord&mdash;just like Jack&apos;s dad. Then Jack&apos;s mom takes off too, dumping Jack with his aunt, uncle, and step-cousins, telling Jack she &quot;needs a break.&quot; Jack decides that he needs his ex-best friend
      back. Only George can help him figure out where people go when others stop believing in them&mdash;and how Jack can put his family back together.
      <br><br>
      Meanwhile, George&mdash;half-walrus, half&ndash;human&mdash;has a problem of his own: he is slowly disappearing, one limb at a time. He hopes that making a new friend will reverse the process, but no one except Jack has ever been able to see him. Rejoining Jack seems like his only hope for survival.
      <br><br>
      Until George discovers new powers that lead him and Jack on a new adventure&mdash;one that neither of them ever imagined.
